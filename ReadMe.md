# TLM Ninja login API Coding challenge

My take on the TLM Ninja Coding Challenge üê±‚Äçüë§

## Introduction
![Demo](demo.png)

This project contains a reusable Django application that logs authentication events to database.
It also provides a fully working project that demonstrates the use of the module.

## Installation in an existing project

* Install the package: `pip install git+https://github.com/francislr/coding-challenge-login-api`
* Add the application to `settings.py`:
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'therewasanattempt.apps.security_auth_attempt.SecurityAuthAttemptConfig',
    ]
    ```
* Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

## Setup development environment

* Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment
* Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`<br>
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Copy `therewasanattempt/settings.py.dist` to `therewasanattempt/settings.py`
* Edit `therewasanattempt/settings.py`
  * By default, the `SECRET_KEY` setting is taken from the `APP_SECRET` environment variable
* Run the usual Django setup commands:
  * `python manage.py migrate`
  * `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Install frontend dependencies by typing `yarn` or `npm install`
* Build the frontend: `yarn build` or `npm run build`

## API

The project exposes an API endpoint which can be used to retrieve the 30 most recent authentication events.

### Authenticate

For accessing the API, you must get an *AccessToken*.

#### Request
**URL**
`/api/login`
**Method**
`POST`
**Request Body**
```
{
    "username": "{username}",
    "password": "{password}"
}
```

#### Responses
##### Success
```
{
    "token": "{accessToken}"
}
```
##### Error
```
{
    "non_field_errors": "Unable to log in with provided credentials."
}
```


### Last 30 authentication events

Return the last 30 authentication events.
You must supply a valid *AccessToken* 

#### Request
**URL**
`/api/attempt-event`
**Method**
`GET`
**Request Header**
`Authorization: Token {AccessToken}`

#### Responses
##### Success
```
[
    {
        "time_created": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.215339Z",
        "username": "ninja",
        "ip_address": "1.1.1.1",
        "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (...",
        "result": "SUCC"
    },
...
]
```
##### Error
```
{
    "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."."
}
```


# The Challenge

Your mission: Create and deploy a `django` application exposing a REST API that will provide details on _login attempts_.
Example details would be IP Address, Region, success and failure attempts count, anything else you think that sounds interesting.

## Requirements

### Backend

- [x] Expose a REST API
- [x] Have a way to authenticate with the API
- [x] Write unit tests to validate API behaviour

### Frontend

- [x] Have a frontend app, page or django view to login and consume the API
- [x] List login attempts with details

### The Rules

- [x] Deployed applicaton must be used on a secure connection (https)
- [x] Code must be open source
- [x] There must be a license for the code (of your choice)
- [x] You must use `git` (you can fork this repo or create a new one)
- [x] Commit messages should follow [the seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- [x] Your project should follow [12 factor](https://12factor.net/) principles

### Deliverable

- [x] Link to git repository
- [x] Url to live application
- [x] Credentials so we can try your application

### Advices

* **Try to design and implement your solution as you would do for real production code.** Show us how you create clean, maintainable code that does awesome stuff. Build something that we'd be happy to contribute to. This is not a programming contest where dirty hacks win the game.
* Feel free to add more features!
* Documentation and maintainability is a plus.
* **Don't you forget those unit tests.**
* We don‚Äôt want to know if you can do exactly as asked (or everybody would have the same result). We want to know what you bring to the table when working on a project, what is your secret sauce. More features? Best solution? Thinking outside the box?
* Make sure you apply security good practices. Ninjas hide their secrets because pirates will find them.
